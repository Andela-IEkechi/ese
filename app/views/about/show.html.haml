          %p.white-text I am a humanist. I am passionate about the interests and welfare of human beings especially women and children. I am a wife and a co-sleeping, attachment parenting, badass breastfeeding mum. Since the birth of my son, I have learnt to slow down and pay attention. I consider him my greatest teacher. I am interested in the study of psychological abuse, mental health matters, emotional intelligence and authenticity. I am a qualified attorney with a Masters degree in International Law and Financial Markets. I am currently studying to qualify as a professional Counselor and Child Psychologist.
          %p.white-text After decades of enduring abuse in various forms, I have learned to rise above it all and dare to start living my authentic life. I want to help you do the same.
          %p.white-text How?
          %p.white-text For starters, by creating this platform where I can share my findings, experiences and failures so that you can better understand that your experience is not ​peculiar​ and you too can turn your mess into a message. Ultimately, I want you to have a safe space where you can learn how to free yourself from repetitive abusive patterns, arm yourself with some emotional intelligence, find your authentic voice, and go on to help others do the same.
          -#%p.white-text My book ​NAKED​ will be published on the 28th of March 2016. That means you can call me an author too ...
          %p.white-text Welcome…
