      %h5 I am a humanist. I am passionate about the interests and welfare of human beings especially women and children. I am a wife and a co-sleeping, attachment parenting, badass breastfeeding mum. Since the birth of my son, I have learnt to slow down and pay attention. I consider him my greatest teacher. I am interested in the study of psychological abuse, mental health matters, emotional intelligence and authenticity. I am a qualified attorney with a Masters degree in International Law and Financial Markets. I am currently studying to qualify as a professional Counselor and Child Psychologist.
